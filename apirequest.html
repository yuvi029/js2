    <p>XMLHttpRequest (XHR) is a JavaScript object used to interact with servers — it allows you to send HTTP requests and receive data without reloading the web page.</p>
     <p>readyState	State Name	Description
	<ul>
    <li><b>UNSENT</b>	The XMLHttpRequest object is created, but the open() method hasn’t been called yet.</li>
	<li><b>OPENED</b>	The open() method has been called — the request is set up but not sent.</li>
	<li><b>HEADERS_RECEIVED</b>	send() has been called, and the response headers have been received.</li>
	<li><b>LOADING</b>	The response body is being received (data is being downloaded).</li>
